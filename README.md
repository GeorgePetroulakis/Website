This website uses the framework django. The website was developed with python, javascript, and html+css. This website has not been made public yet and is still being worked on.

I designed this website as a comprehensive social networking platform that allows users to create profiles, connect with friends, and share content seamlessly.

After signing up and logging in, users can personalize their profiles by adding details like email addresses and social media links, enhancing their online presence.

A key feature of the site is the ability for users to follow and unfollow each other, fostering meaningful connections within the community. The intuitive search functionality 

enables users to find and connect with others effortlessly by searching for usernames. In addition to social connections, users can create and manage topics, allowing them to 

categorize and organize their thoughts, ideas, or interests. Each topic can contain multiple entries, enabling users to share detailed reflections or updates related to specific 

subjects. This functionality encourages users to engage more deeply with their interests and with each other through shared topics.The interface displays each user's friend list, 

showcasing the number of followers they have, and includes interactive buttons for adding or removing friends with just one click. Users can post updates, which are prominently 

featured in their feeds, encouraging engagement and interaction among friends.I ensured that the design is responsive, so navigation elements adapt beautifully to different screen sizes, 

providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. Overall, this website combines social interaction features, robust search capabilities, topic management, 

and a user-friendly layout, allowing users to navigate their connections, share experiences, and engage with topics of interest in a visually appealing and engaging environment.
